Copy $MYWALLPAPER.jpg to *this* directory then run

$ fbsetbg -u xv -f $MYWALLPAPER.jpg

From now on

$ fbsetbg -l

will load that same wallpaper, and fluxbox will do that when it starts.

Instead of "xv", a number of other wallpaper settings tools can be used as
well. Look into the Perl source code of "fbsetbg" to see which ones are
supported.
